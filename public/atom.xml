        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;ordered a MacBook, but it wasn&#x27;t ready for me yet.
Instead, I got this big, clunky Windows laptop.
It was heavy, you could easily kill someone or yourself just by carrying it.
I booted it up, and the first thing it did was to update Windows.
In the meantime, my manager gave me my AD login and told me to request admin rights.
After 30 minutes of Windows update and restarts, I finally saw the login screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to cope with the absurd and frustrating?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people go insane, while others write it down to cope with the pain. I am writing this to describe the journey I am on right now, because usually people don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them these stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I joined a new company. I was excited because it is a global company, and I had the chance to work at the &amp;quot;heart of the company,&amp;quot; where the guy who invented the system was still working on the project.
